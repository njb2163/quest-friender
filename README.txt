Steps one-by-one:

This is in the works... (For Checkpoint 4 skip to Step 5.)

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. cd frontend
3. npm install
4. npm run start-all

This will start both the Flask server and the React server!

React will open:
http://localhost:3000

Flask will serve as the API from example:
http://localhost:5000/api/profile

----------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5. However, for now, run the following in terminal:

6. cd frontend
7. npm install
8. npm start

To see the screens, navigate to:

Profile screen is on http://localhost:3000/
Quest screen is on http://localhost:3000/questDetails
