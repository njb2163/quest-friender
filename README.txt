Steps one by one.

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. cd frontend
3. npm install
4. npm run start-all

This will start both the Flask server and the React server!

React will open:
http://localhost:3000

Flask will serve as the API from example:
http://localhost:5000/api/profile

Thanks!
