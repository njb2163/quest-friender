Steps one-by-one:

This will run both the Flask server and React server:

1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run start-all

This will start both the Flask server and the React server!

React will open:
http://localhost:3000

Flask will serve as the API from example:
http://localhost:5000/api/profile
