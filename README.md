# Quest-Friender-App

This is an appication created with the goal of helping students at Columbia with making new connections.  

The idea is that students can fill out a personality quiz, then they can join quests, and the application will match them with others who have the most similar personality.  

The quests consist of 15-30 min activities that are oritented towards having users get to know their team members better.  

This application is a result of a semester long research project which involved:  
1.  Identifying the problem  
2.  Interviewing stakeholders for feedback  
3.  Journey mapping  
4.  Low fidelity prototyping
4.  Smoke and Mirrors prototyping  
5.  High fidelity prototyping  
6.  Implementation of the application  

This repository only contains the result which is point 6 above.
